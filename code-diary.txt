- Want to tick off smaller parts of big tasks and break it down
- Want to visualise progress towards bigger task
- Make progress chart (either pie chart or progress bar)
- Simple interface, increment how many have, different progress, visuals

- creating basic html, css and javascript to start with
- don't know how to make chart, so will just make a text value that inc/dec
- need to set number of items in task so can have max value - needs to be easy
  to edit
- if current value > new max, it automatically fixes the bound
- init git repository so can backtrack

Ideas:
- use sass instead of css
- use react to make structure more object-like

Next steps:
- figure out how to make chart in javascript: chart or D3, have used D3 before
  but for this project, simple chart is probably better

- show percentage
- ability to set task name

- created bar chart
- struggling with axis options for min & max values. This works:
scales: {
            xAxes: [{ticks: {min: 10, max:60}}]
        }
- setting min and max of chart with bounds of data
- switching over from text value to chart value
- updating chart data with increment

Ideas:
- can select colour theme 
- can select bar vs donut for chart

21:25-22:36
- chart functionality complete
- add task name input box
- move some css to be inline if it is just 1 line for an element
- also move stuff around in file so it is elements, classes, then IDs
- update chart name when submit form - changed function to update max & name
  in one, and renamed it updateSettings()
- add percentage below settings
- update whenever max updates or inc / dec -> calc complete/total & put % sign
